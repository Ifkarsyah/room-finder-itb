### Installing
Before you started, you must create one Messaging API app(you can refer [here](https://developers.line.me/en/docs/messaging-api/getting-started/) and set the "Use Webhooks" to "Enabled". So, you can pass your Herokuapp to the Line's Webhooks URL setting.

Clone this repository.

git clone https://github.com/Ifkarsyah/room-finder-itb.git
```
Get your "Channel-Access-Token" and "Channel-Secret" and place them in row 16-17

```
line_bot_api = LineBotApi('Channel-Access-Token')
handler = WebhookHandler('Channel-Secret')
```

Go to your Heroku account and go to "Deploy" tab and follow their [instruction](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/{YOUR-APP-NAME}/deploy/heroku-git).
